# Codex Development TODO - MVP Focus

## Current Status (as of 2025-10-28)
**What's Working:**
- ‚úì Cobra CLI framework integrated
- ‚úì `codex ask [question]` command with argument parsing
- ‚úì `codex config show` displays environment variables
- ‚úì Binary builds successfully
- ‚úì Internal package structure created (internal/config, internal/context, internal/providers, internal/errors)
- ‚úì Logging framework integrated (zerolog)
- ‚úì **Environment variable loading (.env support)**
- ‚úì **Anthropic API integration with streaming**
- ‚úì **End-to-end query flow working**
- ‚úì **Context gathering (basic filesystem)**
- ‚úì **Repository fetching (local and remote)**

**üéâ MVP ACHIEVED! üéâ**
```bash
codex ask "what is 2 + 2?"
# ‚Üí Loads API key from .env file
# ‚Üí Gathers context (filesystem, repos)
# ‚Üí Sends to Claude API with context
# ‚Üí Streams response to terminal
# ‚Üí Returns answer: "2 + 2 equals 4"
```

## MVP Tasks (Essential Only)

### 1. Configuration Management ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Load config from ~/.config/codex/config.yaml
- [x] Simple config structure: repo paths, API key
- [x] Basic validation (paths exist, API key present)
- [x] .env file support for API keys
- [x] Environment variable override support

### 2. Context Gathering (In-Memory, No Caching) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Read configured repository paths from config
- [x] Simple file reading from those repos
- [x] Build context string from gathered data
- [x] Basic filesystem context (working directory)
- [ ] Basic dotfiles parsing (grep for patterns in common config files) - DEFERRED

### 3. Single AI Provider (Anthropic Only) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Basic Anthropic API client
- [x] Read API key from config/environment (.env)
- [x] Send prompt with context
- [x] Stream response to terminal
- [x] Basic error handling (fail fast)
- [x] Using Claude 3 Opus model

### 4. Query Processing (Minimal) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Accept user query from CLI
- [x] Build simple prompt: "Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {query}"
- [x] Send to Anthropic
- [x] Display response (streamed)

### 5. Basic Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for config loading
- [ ] Unit tests for context gathering
- [x] Manual integration testing - WORKING!

## Current Issues & Next Steps

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Repository Content Not Being Read (2025-10-28)
**Problem:** Configured repositories (nixos, dotfiles) are detected but their contents are NOT being sent to the AI.
- Test query: "What shell am I using and what are some of my custom aliases?"
- Expected: Should read ~/.dotfiles/zsh/ files and provide specific answers
- Actual: AI responds "I would need to look at your shell configuration files" - indicating it's not receiving file contents
- Root cause: RepoFetcher only verifies paths exist (repo_fetcher.go:26-32) but doesn't read/parse file contents
- Context gatherer (gatherer.go:98-122) calls FetchRepo but doesn't process the returned repository data
- **Next step**: Implement actual file reading and content extraction in context gathering
  - Add methods to read directory contents from configured repos
  - Parse common config files (.zshrc, .bashrc, .nix files, etc.)
  - Format repository contents into context string that gets sent to AI
  - See internal/context/gatherer.go:98-122 for where this logic needs to be added

## Future Features (Post-MVP)

- **Caching**: SQLite database for parsed config caching with TTL/invalidation
- **Screenshot Support**: Integrate screenshot tools for visual context
- **Multiple Providers**: OpenAI, local LLM (Ollama), provider switching
- **Smart Context**: Token counting, size warnings, user confirmation for large contexts
- **Advanced Parsing**: Deep Nix flake parsing, home-manager config analysis
- **Polish**: Progress indicators, shell completions, better error messages
- **Interactive Mode**: Multi-turn conversations with context persistence
- **Query History**: Store and search past queries
- **Plugin System**: Custom context providers and config parsers

## Questions & Decisions
- **AI Backend**: Anthropic Claude for MVP, expand later
- **Priority**: Prove core value first, optimize later
- **No Database**: Parse on-demand for MVP
- **No Screenshots**: Defer until after basic queries work
- **Logging**: zerolog (already integrated)
- **Repository Model**: Configured repos from config file

## Recent Commits & Progress
- **[uncommitted]** (2025-10-28): Added nixos and dotfiles repositories to config
  - Added ~/nixos and ~/.dotfiles to configured_repos via `codex config add-repo`
  - Updated config.yaml with nix_config_path and dotfiles_path
  - Enhanced `codex config show` command to read from config file (was only reading env vars)
  - Fixed cmd/config.go to load and display actual configuration
  - Discovered critical issue: repository contents not being read/sent to AI

  - Created internal/providers/provider.go with AI provider interface
  - Created internal/providers/anthropic.go, openai.go, ollama.go with provider skeletons

## Notes
- Project uses Go 1.24.4 with Nix development environment
- Database migrations via goose (SQLite backend) - not yet implemented
- Focus on being context-aware without being intrusive
- Privacy-conscious design (local processing where possible)
- All parsed context will be stored as JSON in SQLite
- User confirmation required for large context to avoid unexpected API costs
- Cobra provides auto-generated shell completion support
